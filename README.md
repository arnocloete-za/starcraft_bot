# starcraft_bot
My own Starcarft2 bot. 

There is a python library available to help you get quickly started with a Starcaft2 bot. It is fun!

Getting started:
pip install burnysc2
See more at https://burnysc2.github.io/python-sc2/docs/text_files/introduction.html


To get started look at:
https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2/tree/develop

Unfortunately you have to be in Windows to run your program. It will startup Starcraft2.
